#### 🌱 Organic Food Traceability System

A transparent way to trace organic food from farm to table.

The Organic Food Traceability System provides end-to-end visibility for organic food products using a digital supply-chain tracking workflow. Built with React, Node.js, and Supabase, this system allows farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to verify food authenticity and ensure transparency.


## 📖 About the Project

Consumers often face difficulty verifying whether a product is genuinely organic. Farmers and retailers lack transparent systems to document the journey of food items.

This project solves that by enabling:

✔ Tracking a product’s journey from the farm → processing → packaging → distribution → retailer → consumer
✔ Providing authenticity verification
✔ Storing data securely using Supabase
✔ A clean and modern React UI for interaction
✔ Node.js APIs for backend integration
